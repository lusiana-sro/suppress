*Are you looking for a way to easily integrate complex AI features into your applications?* With Suppress, you can quickly and easily add features and *take your app to the next level!*

Here is an [[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/backend-ai-daniel-rosel][article]] demonstrating the power of suppress.js.

* Hello World

[[./hello_world-2x.gif]]

1. =npm i ai.suppress.js=
2. Create a file named =server.js= and add the following code:
    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
      const {OpenAILLM , DataGenerator, SuppresServer} = require('ai.suppress.js');

      const llm = new OpenAILLM("OPENAI_API_KEY");
      const server = new SuppresServer();

      server.createEndpoint(
          "/hello/:name/:country",
          "GET",
          new DataGenerator(
              "Write a greeting for {name}. Create a brief description of {country}, in which the user lives.",
              JSON.stringify({"greeting":"string", "description":"string"}),
              llm
              )
          );

      server.start();
    #+END_SRC
3. Run the server using =node server.js=
4. Open your browser and go to =http://localhost:3000/hello/John/China= [Replace with your name and country]

* Huh?
Not really sure what this does? Here are some examples of what you can do with Suppress.js: [[./DEMOS.org][Demos]].
* Using Suppress.js and AI Responsibly
Language Models may not be accurate or reliable in their output. When utilizing a language model such as GPT3, it is important to remember that it may be biased towards topics that are more widely discussed, and that its output could be wrong despite appearing confident. Therefore, it is important to always verify any advice or content generated by a language model.
* Models
Suppress.js primarily runs on OpenAI's GPT3 model. However, if you want to implement other commonly used models, you can take a loot at the [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/mix.suppress.js][mix.suppress.js]] package on npm. With this package, you can easily switch between models, and even combine them to create a more powerful model. Currently supports:
+ ðŸ¤— Hugging-face - Most
+ OpenAI - Anything

* Features
+ Gives structure to data produced by LLMs
+ Allows for effortless integration of AI into existing projects
+ You send the data, suppress handles it. You want the data? Suppress gets it.
+ Support for the following LLMs: /Open Ai/

* Coming Soon
+ [ ] MongoDB Integration
+ [ ] Azure OpenAI API - Should decrease response time

* Contributing
Any contributions are welcome, feel free to send me an email at [[mailto:daniel@alves.world]] for any questions or concerns. Im always looking for new ideas and ways to improve the framework.
