2. Create a file named =server.js= and add the following code:
    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
      const {SuppressLLM , DataGenerator, SuppresServer} = require('ai.suppress.js');
      const llm = new SuppressLLM("OPENAI_API_KEY");
      const server = new SuppresServer();

      server.createEndpoint(
          "/hello/:name/:country",
          "GET",
          new DataGenerator(
              "Greet {name}. Create a brief description of {country}, in which the user lives.",
              JSON.stringify({"greeting":"string", "description":"string"}),
              llm
              )
          );

      server.start();

* Using Suppress.js and AI Responsibly
Language Models may not be accurate or reliable in their output. When utilizing a language model such as GPT3, it is important to remember that it may be biased towards topics that are more widely discussed, and that its output could be wrong despite appearing confident. Therefore, it is important to always verify any advice or content generated by a language model.
