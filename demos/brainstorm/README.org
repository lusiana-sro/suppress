#+title: Brainstorming with Suppress Storage

Do you even just need to quickly manage some data that is coming in ad-hoc? Within a few minutes, with suppress.js, you can have a simple storage system up and running. It's a great way to get started with a new project, or to quickly prototype something.

First, create your server:

#+begin_src javascript
  const config = require('./config.json');
  const {OpenAILLM, DataGenerator, SuppresServer, SuppressSequence, DataStorage } = require("ai.suppress.js");

  // the key we are getting here is for OpenAI
  let storage = new DataStorage("Brainstorming", config.key); // Create a new storage object
  // we set the database name to use as "Brainstorming"
  let server = new SuppresServer();
  server.mountDatabase(storage);

  server.start(3001);
#+end_src

As easy as that... Now put together a simple client, you can find my demos in this folder. We are also working on a simple client for EVERYTHING that will be available soon ðŸ˜‰.

And now, all you need to do is start brainstorming!
